I"Q<p>The relationship between two quantities that have the same dimensions are interchangeable through <strong>conversion factors</strong>. For example, a rod that has a length of 5 m can also be presented in feet (ft), since both meter and feet are units that represent the dimension of length, where $1 \,\text{m}=3.28\,\text{ft}$.</p>
