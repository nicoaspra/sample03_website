I"U<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered how a car can easily pass a bike, why a rainbow appears after a rainstorm, how electricity is made, or why oil floats when mixed with water? Humans, by nature, are inquisitive creatures. Every speck and aspect of our existence tends to be questioned. But it’s not just the questions that pique our curiosity; the solutions, after all, are far more intriguing, and that’s what we will attempt to provide. Filipinos, for example, are superstitious people that give absurd explanations for even the most mundane events.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Umuulan kahit tirik ang araw dahil may kinakasal na tikbalang,” 
or
“Nagkakasakit dahit na engkanto,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These statements are just a few of the things we hear from the elderly. However, because of advances in science and technology as well as extensive research, what was formerly thought to be magical and mysterious may now be rationally justified. All of this is feasible thanks to science and mathematics, and more importantly, physics.</p>

<p>Physics explains such occurrences by combining mathematics with scientific data and concepts. This is the beauty of physics: it provides solutions and explanations to concepts that are not well understood. And, despite the large amount of data that has been verified, there are still a lot to learn. After all, physics is still a relatively new discipline.</p>

<p>As we tackle this subject, we will do everything we can to help you appreciate physics and how you may apply it to your everyday life from a scientific standpoint.</p>

<p>But, before we can examine the foundations of physics, we must first grasp its fundamental notions. And it all starts with properly quantifying the dimensions.</p>
