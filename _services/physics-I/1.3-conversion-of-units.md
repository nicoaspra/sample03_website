The relationship between two quantities that have the same dimensions are interchangeable through [conversion factors](#conversion-factors). For example, a rod that has a length of 5 m can also be presented in feet [ft], since both meter and feet are units that represent the dimension of length, where $1 \,\text{m}=3.28\,\text{ft}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
	\text{Length} &= 5\text{ \cancel{m}} \br{ \frac{3.28 \text{ft}}{1\text{ \cancel{m}}} } \\
	&= 16.4 \text{ ft} 	\tagans
\end{align*}
