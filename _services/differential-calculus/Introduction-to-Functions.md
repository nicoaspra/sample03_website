# Objective

A function is a special relationship between an input and an output, where the value of the output depends on the value of the input, given that **for every input there can only be one output**. Imagine the function as a juicer, if you use it on an apple you cannot expect a different type of juice other than an apple juice (figure 1).

Relating this to an equation, for example $$y=2x+1$$. The variable $$x$$ is our apple (input), $$y$$ is the apple juice (output) and $$2x+1$$ is the juicer (function). The function tells us what to do to our input in order to end up with the resulting output.
