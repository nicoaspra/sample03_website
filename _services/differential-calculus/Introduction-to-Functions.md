# Objective

A function is a special relationship between an input and an output, where the value of the output depends on the value of the input, given that **for every input there can only be one output**. Imagine the function as a juicer, if you use it on an apple you cannot expect a different type of juice other than an apple juice (Figure 1).

    size= "60%"
%}


Relating this to an equation, for example $y=2x+1 \CC\degC$. The variable $x$ is our apple (input), $y$ is the apple juice (output) and $2x+1$ is the juicer (function). The function tells us what to do to our input in order to end up with the resulting output. $\brc{5\x10^{-12}}\un{m} \ddw\degg$
